Node Class:

The Node class is used to create instances of a linked list node. Each node represents information about a candidate, including name, gender, ID type, ID number, mobile number, and comorbidities.
The class has an __init__ method to initialize the attributes of a node.
Global Variables:

Several global variables (n, state, dis, hos, date, hour) are declared at the beginning of the code but are not used or modified within the provided snippet. They may be intended for future use or could be remnants of earlier versions of the code.
Functions:

heading function:

Prints the heading for the program. However, the actual implementation of this function is missing in the provided code. You might want to include the code for this function.
details function:

Takes candidate details, such as name, gender, ID type, ID number, mobile number, and comorbidities.
Uses a loop to collect details for multiple candidates (up to a maximum of 4).
Clears the console screen using the os.system("cls") command.
Creates a new Node instance for each candidate and adds it to a linked list.
venue function:

Placeholder function that prints "Venue." The actual implementation of this function is missing in the provided code.
receipt function:

Placeholder function that prints "Receipt." The actual implementation of this function is missing in the provided code.
Driver Code:

The __main__ block calls the details, venue, and receipt functions in sequence.
Issues/Improvements:

The start variable is used to keep track of the start of the linked list, but it is not declared as global within the details function. Therefore, the start variable inside the function creates a local variable, and changes made to it won't affect the global variable. You may need to use the global keyword before start inside the details function.

The heading function implementation is missing, and it seems to be called within the details function.

The venue and receipt functions are placeholders and need to be implemented for the program to have meaningful functionality beyond candidate details input.

The usage of global variables should be minimized if possible. Passing parameters to functions and returning values can make the code more modular and easier to understand.

The use of os.system("cls") for clearing the console is platform-specific (Windows), and it might not work on other platforms. Consider using a more portable solution, such as os.system("clear") for Unix-like systems.
